# C# Demo

A small C# console app that accepts a Kloudless App ID and a service to
authenticate, and lists the contents of the root folder for the account
connected.

## Variables

`Program.cs` contains the main entry point and also allows you to
hard-code the App ID used. By default, the program prompts for the App
ID.

`Util.cs` contains the `BASE_URL` of the API Server. The base URL may
be modified to point to either the cloud version or a private instance.
